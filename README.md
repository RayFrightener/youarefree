##### It's super important to have a mission statement or some statement, which when read, puts the reader back in why the platform is being build.

# Mission and Vision

Read, reflect and get uplifted and leave enriched to take on life with all fear removed and in a state to live freely.
Come, Wake up and leave all ready to live life freely.

# Core User Experience

A platform for pure uplifting thoughts/idea. Share but more importantly read yourself to stay in a state of remembrance of Truth because it always starts with getting lost in the sauce and forgetting.=

# Guiding Principles:

What must not be compromised in the UX, moderation, or interaction model?

-> reflection of the truth of your nature
-> stay connected with your true nature by reflecting on the expressions and posts made by the Unbound.
-> share, interact and lift yourself and others.
-> comment and the act of engaging should itself be uplifting.

# Intention

You are free, you are not bound by anything, freedom is your nature, break free from the programming and wake up like this and then have the user experience be so enriching that the user leaves the platform feeling enriched to take on life, all fear is removed and the user is empowered to live freely.

# What is the UX?

-> land on the Welcome page, get greeted by the truth of your nature + stay connected with your true nature by reflecting on the statement + posts made by the Unbound.
-> Sign up to become the Unbound, post, =interact and lift yourself and others.
